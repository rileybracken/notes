### Pop Culture, the Pendulum, and Progress in Software - [Jamison Dance](https://twitter.com/jergason)
How does software progress?

Two schools of thought Software is art; and software is a sience.

How does science progress?

Paradigms, i.e. OOP -> find the anomalies -> exploration the anomalies ->  Then a new paradigm.

Is software science? Science progresses.

"The web was done by amatures"

Progress?

There are a lot of old good ideas that are being reinvented, are we progressing?

How does art progress?
Django Reinhart, jazz musician 1930's. Jimi Hendrix 1960's. Stevie Vaughn nowadays.

Who is better? There are technical differences, not better, it is art, art is subjective.

In art there is no better or worse, there is different.

Is software art?

Programming is a flat circle. Things repeat, microsoft dev in the 90's is very similar to redux now.

Pendulums:
Frameworks -> Libraries
Monolith -> Micro Services
Static -> Dynamic (type safety)
Thin Client -> Thick Client

Thin Client - Logic happens on the server (server side rendering)
Thick Client - Logic happens on the client

Programming is not art but **make art, do science**. Look for the pendulum.

Find **old good** ideas.
