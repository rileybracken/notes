### Don't Follow Decoys - [Aaron Frost](https://twitter.com/js_dev)

##### Decoys are:
- thing-like object, but not a thing
- its purpose is to make you think it is a thing

You think that's what is expected of you, but it isnt.

##### Red Flags:
1. Attack
2. Put others under bus, to avoid going under?
3. Allow you to make mistakes?
4. Right cause they're loud, or right because they're right?
5. Can you question them?
6. Do they hear you? or only hear themselves?
7. Are they mean?
8. Care about your success?
9. Let you take credit?
10. Use fear as a motivator?
11. Do they delegate? Even fun things?
12. Is "No" a common word?
13. Name drop to get a point accross.

##### Scary:
- You are always a nice person
- You don't like to start things
- Are you just being insubordinate? Or is this a decoy?
- Decoys can only exist if people are too scared or are unprepared to face them

##### Dev Decoy's:
1. Regularly promotes refactors instead of features
2. Refuses to use non-new things
3. Makes things sounds worse than they are
4. Assume the role of lead but have no stated vision for the team
5. Doesn't care about security
6. Old code is crap attitude.
7. Estimates are consistently off by 100s or 1000s of percents off
8. Dodge 80/20 rule? (80% of your time to do 20% of your features)
9. Measure before/after results
10. Frameworks are cap, let's build our own

##### PM Decoy's:
1. Starts projects, doesn't ship.
2. Tells the UX designer how to build the app.
3. Chronic Design Thrashing

##### How to Work with Decoys:
**Do Nothing**

**Become a Leader**

**Ask For Data**

**Ask For Explanations To Help You Understand**

**Raise Concerns With Management**
