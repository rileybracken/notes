### Why your next JavaScript App Should Be Serverless - Todd Wacker
1. Traditional server drawbacks
  - Same boilerplate code
    - User authentication
    - Data management
    - Not very DRY
    - Integrating third party API's

  - Maintanence hassles
    - Server management
    - Dev ops
    - 4am phone calls
    - Scale servers

  - Inefficiencies
    - Paying 24/7 uptime regardless of use
    - Need to anticipate scaling at every instance
    - Problems of scale

2. Serverless benefits
  - What is serverless
    - Servers are run for you by a serverless provider
    - microservices are run in the cloud
    - They do only what you need them to - you only pay for code that is run
    - Custom code can be run in the cloud, away from your other resources
    - User authentication right out of the box
    - Data management without having to write code
    - Functions on demand

  - Benefits
    - No maintenance - set it and forget it
    - Language agnostic, no worry about how something is going to fit into your current infastructure
    - Plays nice with your JS framework of choice
    - No more 4am calls
    - Spend more time building the things that make your app unique, not what makes it the same
    - Overall less hassle = more time to actually write code
    - Better UX because you get to spend more time on it
    - take memory-intensive functions away from the limited front-end resources
    - Simpler - run microservices in the cloud for what you need
